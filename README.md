Calculator with light/dark mode.
Using VScode I created this simple calculator with a toggle for light/dark mode as my first project as I am a beginner developer currently becomming proficient in
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In the future I may add some more mathematical functions and operators on there such as square root, logarithm, sin, cos, and tan.
